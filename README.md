# Face-Recognition-using-PCA
In this project, we implemented a face recognition system by using principal component analysis, which is known as PCA. PCA method provide a mathematical way to reduce the dimension of problem. PCA is a dimension-reduction tool that can be used to reduce a large set of variables to a small set that still contains most of the information in the large set. Principal component analysis is a mathematical procedure that transforms a number of (possibly) correlated variables into a (smaller) number of uncorrelated variables called principal components. The main objective of our project is to recognize faces from the collected set of face data. In our case we have an input 2D image that should be compared with the database. For example, we have a face image with dimensions 300x300. It can be represented as a vector of size 3002, and we would have to compare vectors in R9000 to ﬁnd the best match. However, it is diﬃcult to compute distance in high dimensional spaces. We need to ﬁnd the subspace of Rd where the data structure is preserved. For this purpose PCA tool is used. The aim of this project is to use SVD and PCA for solving FR problem and propose a software to demonstrate how the system works
